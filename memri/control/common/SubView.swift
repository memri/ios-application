    /*
        TODO: There are several problems
                (1) the main reference is in at least .views which means that CompiledView refers
                    to the wrong version main when it is compiling and finding the data item
                (2) the data item that needs to be used to query the properties to dynamically
                    create the view is gotton from currentView.resultSet.item. This is wrong. It
                    must be the dataItem that is passed to SubView.
                (3) I removed dataItem from being passed to SubView as I forgot why this was needed.
                    Can this be inferred from the context? It feels strange to pass it from within
                    the json.
                (4) There is a strange recursion where the SubView gets called again, although the
                    query clearly points to photo, not person. It must somehow not use the proxyMain
                    to render the content. Perhaps Main is references somewhere else as well. I
                    probably want to create any object that has a reference to Main.
